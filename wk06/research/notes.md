# Interview Notes — Week 6

## Participant A
**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]
**Context**: [e.g., Uses keyboard only, prefers dark mode, has ADHD]
**Consent**: ✅ Confirmed verbally
**Duration**: [~10 minutes]

### Q1: Last time you used a task manager
**Response**: "I use Notion for uni work. Last week I had to find all tasks tagged 'COMP2850' to prepare for a deadline. It took ages because the filter kept resetting."

**Observations**:
- Mentioned filter UX issue (cognitive load)
- Time pressure context (deadline stress)
- Tag-based workflow (not just chronological)

**Themes**: `filter_persistence`, `cognitive_load`, `deadline_anxiety`

---

### Q2: What frustrates you?
**Response**: "When I submit a form and nothing happens—like, did it save? I have to refresh the whole page to check."

**Observations**:
- Lack of confirmation feedback
- Low trust in interface
- Workaround = page reload (inefficient)

**Themes**: `status_feedback`, `confirmation`, `trust`

---

### Q3: Lost track of important task?
**Response**: "Yeah, I once forgot to submit coursework because it was buried in my list. I wish there was a way to pin urgent things."

**Observations**:
- List length issue (visibility)
- Prioritisation need
- Consequence = missed deadline (high impact)

**Themes**: `prioritisation`, `visibility`, `urgent_tasks`

---

### Q4: Work without a mouse?
**Response**: "My trackpad broke last month. I tried using Tab to navigate, but some buttons were impossible to reach. Had to borrow a friend's mouse."

**Observations**:
- Keyboard-only experience = friction
- Temporary impairment (broken hardware)
- Exclusion from features

**Themes**: `keyboard_nav`, `temporary_impairment`, `button_accessibility`

---

### Q5: Eyes closed / bright sunlight?
**Response**: "Haven't tried eyes closed, but in sunlight I can't read low-contrast text. I increase zoom but then the layout breaks."

**Observations**:
- Contrast issue (situational disability)
- Zoom breaks responsive design
- Environmental factor (sunlight)

**Themes**: `contrast`, `zoom`, `responsive_design`

---

### Q6: One feature to add?
**Response**: "A way to see progress—like, 'You've completed 8 out of 12 tasks this week.' That would motivate me."

**Observations**:
- Motivation through feedback
- Progress visualisation
- Weekly scope (not just daily)

**Themes**: `progress_tracking`, `motivation`, `feedback`

---

## Summary (Participant A)
**Top pain points**:
1. Filter resets → cognitive overload
2. No confirmation feedback → uncertainty
3. Keyboard navigation gaps → temporary exclusion
4. Contrast issues in bright light → situational disability

**Job story ideas**:
- "When I'm filtering tasks, I want the selection to persist across page reloads so I don't lose my place."
- "When I submit a form, I want immediate confirmation so I know it worked without refreshing."
- "When my mouse breaks, I want full keyboard access so I can still complete tasks."


# Interview Notes — Week 6

## Participant B
**Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]
**Context**: [e.g., uses dual monitors, high multitasking load, sometimes uses screen reader]
**Consent**: ✅ Confirmed verbally
**Duration**: [~12 minutes]

### Q1: Last time you used a task manager
**Response**: "I use One note for uni work. I am always having to jump in between sections to find all my tasks related to one module, but the search is always irrelevant as it searches everything rather than just the folder i am in."

**Observations**:
- stuggles with the search results - too broad
- high switching costs between pages


**Themes**: `search precision`, `cognitive_load`, `context_switching`

---

### Q2: What frustrates you?
**Response**: "when tabs duplicate in the online version, I think I can click too fast, but I end up with 2 copies and I struggle to work out which is up to date."

**Observations**:
- accidental duplication if too fast
- version uncertainty
- produce messy workspace

**Themes**: `version confusion`, `accidental_actions`, `cluttered_workspace`

---

### Q3: Lost track of important task?
**Response**: "Yeah, I ended up rewriting a whole page in notes as I couldn't find it as it was in the wrong section. I like to organise module by module but this misplacement ended up in the wrong module so I could not find it

**Observations**:
- misfiled content
- smarter structure ??
- Consequence = missed deadline (high impact)

**Themes**: `misplacement_risk`, `structure_dependence`, `urgent_tasks`

---

### Q4: Work without a mouse?
**Response**: "I have tried using keyboard shortcuts in the past, specifically when I injured my wrist, some of the actions work fine but in terms of rearranging pages is impossible without dragging the mouse."

**Observations**:
- partial keyboard support
- Temporary physical limitation (injury)
- system needs mouse for spatial tasks (drag)

**Themes**: `keyboard_limitations`, `temporary_injury`, `drag_dependancy`

---

### Q5: Eyes closed / bright sunlight?
**Response**: "In sunlight, i use my screen reader as the glare makes it very hard to see, however some buttons in one note online aren't labelled and so I can just see Button Button."

**Observations**:
- screen reader reliance
- missing ARIA
- accessibility gaps

**Themes**: `screen_reader`, `zoom`, `responsive_design`

---

### Q6: One feature to add?
**Response**: "A way to mark a note as critical so it always stays at the top of the section."

**Observations**:
- need for Pinning pages
- Hierarchical structure
-

**Themes**: `note_pinning`, `motivation`, `visibility`

---

## Summary (Participant B)
**Top pain points**:
1. search is retrieving too much
2. Random duplication -> vision uncertainty
3. Accessibility gaps with screen reader > blocked actions
4. Draging and dropping reliance → keyboard barrier

**Job story ideas**:
- "When I'm searching for a task, I want the results to be limited to the relevant notebook so there isn't excessive results"
- "When I am interacting quickly I want protection against accidental duplication so my space stays clean."
- "When my mouse breaks, I want full keyboard access so I can still complete tasks."
